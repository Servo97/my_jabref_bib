Different approaches to the problem were presented, and a method of performance evaluation was proposed based on minimum-time optimal control with safety constraints. The variable stiffness transmission (VST) scheme was found to be one of a few different possible schemes that allows the most flexibility and potential performance. Some aspects related to the implementation of the mechanics and control of VST actuation were also reported.},

In this paper, we present a new actuation approach that has the requisite characteristics for inherent safety while maintaining the performance expected of modern designs. By drastically reducing the effective impedance of the manipulator while maintaining high-frequency torque capability, we show that the competing design requirements of performance and safety can be successfully integrated into a single manipulation system.},

  abstract = {Human beings subconsciously adapt their behaviors to a communication partner in order to make interactions run smoothly. In human-robot interactions, not only the human but also the robot is expected to adapt to its partner. Thus, to facilitate human-robot interactions, a robot should be able to read subconscious comfort and discomfort signals from humans and adjust its behavior accordingly, just like a human would. However, most previous research works expected the human to consciously give feedback, which might interfere with the aim of interaction. We propose an adaptation mechanism based on reinforcement learning that reads subconscious body signals from a human partner, and uses this information to adjust interaction distances, gaze meeting, and motion speed and timing in human-robot interactions. The mechanism uses gazing at the robot's face and human movement distance as subconscious body signals that indicate a human's comfort and discomfort. A pilot study with a humanoid robot that has ten interaction behaviors has been conducted. The study result of 12 subjects suggests that the proposed mechanism enables autonomous adaptation to individual preferences. Also, detailed discussion and conclusions are presented.},

A collaborative robot's motion must be legible, or intent-expressive. Legibility is often described in the literature as and effect of predictable, unsurprising, or expected motion. Our central insight is that predictability and legibility are fundamentally different and often contradictory properties of motion. We develop a formalism to mathematically define and distinguish predictability and legibility of motion. We formalize the two based on inferences between trajectories and goals in opposing directions, drawing the analogy to action interpretation in psychology. We then propose mathematical models for these inferences based on optimizing cost, drawing the analogy to the principle of rational action. Our experiments validate our formalism's prediction that predictability and legibility can contradict, and provide support for our models. Our findings indicate that for robots to seamlessly collaborate with humans, they must change the way they plan their motion.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We evaluate and quantify the effects of human, robot, and environmental factors on perceived trust in human-robot interaction (HRI).
BACKGROUND: To date, reviews of trust in HRI have been qualitative or descriptive. Our quantitative review provides a fundamental empirical foundation to advance both theory and practice.
METHOD: Meta-analytic methods were applied to the available literature on trust and HRI. A total of 29 empirical studies were collected, of which 10 met the selection criteria for correlational analysis and 11 for experimental analysis. These studies provided 69 correlational and 47 experimental effect sizes.
RESULTS: The overall correlational effect size for trust was r = +0.26,with an experimental effect size of d = +0.71. The effects of human, robot, and environmental characteristics were examined with an especial evaluation of the robot dimensions of performance and attribute-based factors. The robot performance and attributes were the largest contributors to the development of trust in HRI. Environmental factors played only a moderate role.
CONCLUSION: Factors related to the robot itself, specifically, its performance, had the greatest current association with trust, and environmental factors were moderately associated. There was little evidence for effects of human-related factors.
APPLICATION: The findings provide quantitative estimates of human, robot, and environmental factors influencing HRI trust. Specifically, the current summary provides effect size estimates that are useful in establishing design and training guidelines with reference to robot-related factors of HRI trust. Furthermore, results indicate that improper trust calibration may be mitigated by the manipulation of robot design. However, many future research needs are identified.},

A shift from prototyping to manufacturing of the final product necessitates broadening of the material choice, improvement of the surface quality, dimensional stability, and achieving the necessary mechanical properties to meet the performance criteria.

The ability to fabricate objects with high accuracy as well as a wide variety of materials brings much attention to stereolithography. Since its invention in the 1980s, SLA underwent four generations of major technological innovation over the past 40 years. These innovations have thus resulted in a diversified range of stereolithography systems with dramatically improved resolution, throughput, and materials selection for creating complex 3D objects and devices. In this paper, we review the four generations of stereolithography processes, which are scanning, projection, continuous and volumetric stereolithography. For each generation, representative stereolithography system configurations are also discussed in detail. In addition, other derivative technologies, such as scanning–projection, multi-material, and magnetically assisted stereolithography processes, are also included in this review.},

  abstract = {Robots and remote manipulators are anthropometric systems designed to extend man's mobility and manipulative functions to remote locations and unknown environments. These are general purpose devices and must have capabilities for sensing the environment of operation, recognizing patterns and autonomously making control decisions. Two types of systems are recognized: (1) man-supervised semi-autonomous systems, and (2) completely autonomous robot systems. The first type involves dexterous manipulation under human supervision in hazardous and/or remote environments. The second type is usually mobile goal-directed devices which are able to interact independently with their environment and accomplish a set of task objectives in response to high-level commands. This paper introduces the principles and functional organization of control systems of robots and manipulator systems and emphasizes the unique role of learning in system operation. Of particular interest are the properties of trainable control policies which provide the ability to change behavioral patterns with changing environmental statistics and allow performance improvement as experience is acquired. Learning techniques also provide a capability for acquiring human decision making and control policies in an "on the job" mode. That is, the system can observe direct human control action and take over control when training is completed. The potential of combining learning networks with sets of heuristic programs is also of importance. Current applications of learning techniques in robots and manipulators are described. An example of an interactive man-learning control system is discussed, along with results of experimental work. A brief exploratory discussion about the role of learning techniques in future robot and manipulator systems is given. Practical considerations regarding the implementation of learning control systems in real world operations are also discussed.},

  abstract = {Technical aids allow elderly and handicapped people to live independently and supported in their private homes for a longer time. As a contribution to such technological solutions, two demonstrator platforms for a robotic home assistant—called Care-O-bot—were designed and implemented at Fraunhofer IPA, Stuttgart. Whereas Care-O-bot I is only a mobile platform with a touch screen, Care-O-bot II is additionally equipped with adjustable walking supporters and a manipulator arm. It has the capability to navigate autonomously in indoor environments, be used as an intelligent walking support, and execute manipulation tasks. The control software of Care-O-bot II runs on two industrial PCs and a hand-held control panel. The walking aid module is based on sensors in the walking aid handles and on a dynamic model of conventional walking aids. In “direct mode”, the user can move along freely with the robot whereas obstacles are detected and avoided. In “planned mode”, he can specify a target and be lead there by the robotic assistant. Autonomous planning and execution of complex manipulation tasks is based on a symbolic planner and environmental information provided in a database. The user input (graphical and speech input) is transferred to the task planner and adequate actions to solve the task (sequence of motion and manipulation commands) are created. A new method for sensor based manipulation using a tilting laser scanner and camera integrated in the head of the robot has been implemented. Additional sensors in the robot hand increase the grasping capabilities. The walking aid has been tested with elderly users from an assisted living facility and a nursery home. Furthermore, the execution of fetch and carry tasks has been implemented and tested in a sample home environment.},

  abstract   = {Objectives. To evaluate two currently available robotic surgical systems in performing various urologic laparoscopic procedures in an acute porcine model. Methods. Robotic laparoscopic surgery was performed in 14 swine. Data were compared between the da Vinci Robotic System and the Zeus Robotic System. Results. During laparoscopic nephrectomy, the da Vinci System (n = 6) had a significantly shorter total operating room time (51.3 versus 71.6 minutes; P = 0.02) and actual surgical time (42.1 versus 61.4 minutes; P = 0.03) compared with the Zeus System (n = 5). However, the blood loss and adequacy of surgical dissection were comparable between the two groups. For laparoscopic adrenalectomy, the da Vinci System (n = 5) had a shorter actual surgical time (12.2 versus 26.0 minutes; P = 0.006) than did the Zeus System (n = 5). For laparoscopic pyeloplasty, the da Vinci System had a shorter total operating room time (61.4 versus 83.4 minutes; P = 0.10) and anastomotic time (44.7 versus 66.4 minutes; P = 0.11). During pyeloplasty anastomosis, the total number of suture bites per ureter was 13.0 for the da Vinci System (n = 6) and 10.8 for the Zeus System (n = 6). The complications included an adrenal parenchymal tear each during a da Vinci System-based left adrenalectomy and a Zeus System-based right adrenalectomy. An inferior vena caval tear during a Zeus System-based right adrenalectomy occurred in 1 case, which was suture-repaired telerobotically. Conclusions. Robotic laparoscopic procedures can be performed effectively using either the da Vinci or Zeus System. In this limited study, the learning curve and operative times were shorter and the intraoperative technical movements appeared inherently more intuitive with the da Vinci System. Additional clinical experience is necessary.},

  abstract   = {Robots are versatile machines that can perform complex manipulation operations. Recent advances in industrial robotics make robots useful in a wide variety of manufacturing processes. Several recent efforts have demonstrated how robots can be used in additive manufacturing (AM) processes. This paper surveys the work focused on expanding the functional capabilities of AM processes using robots. We identify the following main capabilities realized by performing AM using robots: (1) multi-directional fabrication, (2) conformal deposition, (3) assembling prefabricated components in AM, (4) supportless AM, and (5) large-scale AM. We classify the recent literature in this area in terms of mechanisms, kinematic degrees of freedom (DOF) of the system, types of AM process, and materials. Finally, we discuss the limitations of the current work and the opportunities for future research in this area.},

The last decade has seen substantial growth in research on the problem of robot manipulation, which aims to exploit the increasing availability of affordable robot arms and grippers to create robots capable of directly interacting with the world to achieve their goals. Learning will be central to such autonomous systems, as the real world contains too much variation for a robot to expect to have an accurate model of its environment, the objects in it, or the skills required to manipulate them, in advance. We aim to survey a representative subset of that research which uses machine learning for manipulation. We describe a formalization of the robot manipulation learning problem that synthesizes existing research into a single coherent framework and highlight the many remaining research opportunities and challenges.},

While it is generally accepted in the robotics community that dexterity is desirable and that end effectors with in-hand manipulation capabilities should be developed, there has been little, if any, formal description of why this is needed, particularly given the increased design and control complexity required. This discussion will overview various definitions of dexterity used in the literature and highlight issues related to specific metrics and quantitative analysis. It will also present arguments regarding why hand dexterity is desirable or necessary, particularly in contrast to the capabilities of a kinematically redundant arm with a simple grasper. Finally, we overview and illustrate the various classes of in-hand manipulation, and review a number of dexterous manipulators that have been previously developed. We believe this work will help to revitalize the dialogue on dexterity in the manipulation community and lead to further formalization of the concepts discussed here.},

  abstract = {The human hand capabilities are paramount for highly dexterous manipulation interactions. Unfortunately, the limitations of current technologies make replicating such capabilities unfeasible. Although several works have focused on directly attempting to create robot hands able to mimic human ones closely, few of them have attempted to create generalizable platforms, where robotic hand mechanisms can be iteratively selected and customized to different tasks. In order to build highly dexterous robotic hands in the future, it is crucial to understand not only human manipulation, but also develop methods to leverage robotic mechanisms limitations to mimic human hand interactions accurately. In this letter, we propose an end-to-end framework capable of generating underactuated tendon routings that allow a generic robot hand model to reproduce desired observed human grasp motion synergies accurately. Our contributions are threefold: (1) an end to end framework to generate task-oriented robot hand tendon routings, with the potential to implement desired synergies, (2) a novel grammar based representation of robot hand tendon routings, and (3) a schematic visualization of robot hand tendon routings. The latter two contributions have the potential to embed and compare properties among robot hands. Our results in simulation show that the proposed method produces tendon routing mechanisms that are able to closely mimic the joint trajectories of human subjects performing the same experimental tasks, while achieving dynamically stable grasping postures.},

  abstract   = {Although grasping and manipulation are key aspects of a robotic system's functionality, researchers often only have a limited selection of end effectors compatible with their manipulator base. This may either restrict the robotic system's full range of capabilities or force researchers to compensate for the end effector's intrinsic mechanical disadvantages through compensatory, nonoptimal control strategies. Advances in three-dimensional (3-D) printing have enabled researchers to quickly customize mechanisms for specific tasks, but the end product is usually not intended for extended use. It would be beneficial to identify strategies to augment the capabilities of additive manufacturing techniques to allow the easy and inexpensive construction of durable and functional hardware. To that end, this article details work on the Yale OpenHand Project, a library of lowcost, 3-D-printed, underactuated hand designs for researchers to freely implement and modify for their own use cases. The designs use cast flexural joints made via the hybrid deposition manufacturing (HDM) process to produce robust, impact-resistant subcomponents and help account for the structural shortcomings of fused deposition manufacturing (FDM). Several of these design examples are presented, evaluated, and compared with commercial alternatives. We hope that providing an accessible and extensible set of open-source hand designs will improve the iterative design process and produce many more options for researchers to utilize.},

Based on these primitives, we examine a simple, heuristic finger gait which enables continuous object rotation for a wide variety of object shapes and sizes. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our dexterous soft robotic hand in three real-world cases: unscrewing the cap of a jar, orienting food items for packaging, and gravity compensation during grasping. Overall, we show that even for complex tasks such as in-hand manipulation, soft robots can perform robustly without the need for local sensing or complex control.},

With an increased requirement for automation, robotics systems are required to perform task in unstructured and not well defined environments; conditions which conventional rigid robotics are not best suited. This requires a paradigm shift in the methods and materials used to develop robots such that they can adapt to and work safely in human environments. One solution to this is soft robotics, which enables soft interactions with the surroundings while maintaining the ability to apply significant force. This review paper assesses the current materials and methods, actuation methods and sensors which are used in the development of soft manipulators. The achievements and shortcomings of recent technology in these key areas are evaluated, and this paper concludes with a discussion on the potential impacts of soft manipulators on industry and society.},

However, this evolution means breaking with the established safety procedures as the separation of workspaces between robot and human is removed. These changes are reflected in safety standards related to industrial robotics since the last decade, and have led to the development of a wide field of research focusing on the prevention of human-robot impacts and/or the minimization of related risks or their consequences.

Additionally, a review is provided of the current regulations along with new concepts that have been introduced in them.

The parallelogram links are then integrated into a delta robot structure to test for delta mechanism behavior, which keeps the end-effector parallel to the base of the robot.

To model the kinematics of delta robots with soft compliant links, which diverge from typical rigid links, we train neural networks using a perception system.

  abstract  = {Highly constrained manipulation tasks continue to be challenging for autonomous robots as they require high levels of precision, typically less than 1mm, which is often incompatible with what can be achieved by traditional perception systems. This paper demonstrates that the combination of state-of-the-art object tracking with passively adaptive mechanical hardware can be leveraged to complete precision manipulation tasks with tight, industrially-relevant tolerances (0.25mm). The proposed control method closes the loop through vision by tracking the relative 6D pose of objects in the relevant workspace. It adjusts the control reference of both the compliant manipulator and the hand to complete object insertion tasks via within-hand manipulation. Contrary to previous efforts for insertion, our method does not require expensive force sensors, precision manipulators, or time-consuming, online learning, which is data hungry. Instead, this effort leverages mechanical compliance and utilizes an object agnostic manipulation model of the hand learned offline, off-the-shelf motion planning, and an RGBD-based object tracker trained solely with synthetic data. These features allow the proposed system to easily generalize and transfer to new tasks and environments. This paper describes in detail the system components and showcases its efficacy with extensive experiments involving tight tolerance peg-in-hole insertion tasks of various geometries as well as open-world constrained placement tasks.},

  abstract   = {Deep reinforcement learning has produced many success stories in recent years. Some example fields in which these successes have taken place include mathematics, games, health care, and robotics. In this paper, we are especially interested in multi-agent deep reinforcement learning, where multiple agents present in the environment not only learn from their own experiences but also from each other and its applications in multi-robot systems. In many real-world scenarios, one robot might not be enough to complete the given task on its own, and, therefore, we might need to deploy multiple robots who work together towards a common global objective of finishing the task. Although multi-agent deep reinforcement learning and its applications in multi-robot systems are of tremendous significance from theoretical and applied standpoints, the latest survey in this domain dates to 2004 albeit for traditional learning applications as deep reinforcement learning was not invented. We classify the reviewed papers in our survey primarily based on their multi-robot applications. Our survey also discusses a few challenges that the current research in this domain faces and provides a potential list of future applications involving multi-robot systems that can benefit from advances in multi-agent deep reinforcement learning.},

  abstract   = {Search and Rescue (SAR) missions in remote environments often employ autonomous multi-robot systems that learn, plan, and execute a combination of local single-robot control actions, group primitives, and global mission-oriented coordination and collaboration. Often, SAR coordination strategies are manually designed by human experts who can remotely control the multi-robot system and enable semi-autonomous operations. However, in remote environments where connectivity is limited and human intervention is often not possible, decentralized collaboration strategies are needed for fully-autonomous operations. Nevertheless, decentralized coordination may be ineffective in adversarial environments due to sensor noise, actuation faults, or manipulation of inter-agent communication data. In this paper, we propose an algorithmic approach based on adversarial multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) that allows robots to efficiently coordinate their strategies in the presence of adversarial inter-agent communications. In our setup, the objective of the multi-robot team is to discover targets strategically in an obstacle-strewn geographical area by minimizing the average time needed to find the targets. It is assumed that the robots have no prior knowledge of the target locations, and they can interact with only a subset of neighboring robots at any time. Based on the centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) paradigm in MARL, we utilize a hierarchical meta-learning framework to learn dynamic team-coordination modalities and discover emergent team behavior under complex cooperative-competitive scenarios. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated on a collection of prototype grid-world environments with different specifications of benign and adversarial agents, target locations, and agent rewards.},

  abstract  = {Communication enables agents to cooperate to achieve their goals. Learning when to communicate, i.e., sparse (in time) communication, and whom to message is particularly important when bandwidth is limited. However, recent work in learning sparse individualized communication suffers from high variance during training, where decreasing communication comes at the cost of decreased reward, particularly in cooperative tasks. We use the information bottleneck to reframe sparsity as a representation learning problem, which we show naturally enables lossless sparse communication at lower budgets than prior art. In this paper, we propose a method for true lossless sparsity in communication via Information Maximizing Gated Sparse Multi-Agent Communication (IMGS-MAC). Our model uses two individualized regularization objectives, an information maximization autoencoder and sparse communication loss, to create informative and sparse communication. We evaluate the learned communication ‘language’ through direct causal analysis of messages in non-sparse runs to determine the range of lossless sparse budgets, which allow zero-shot sparsity, and the range of sparse budgets that will inquire a reward loss, which is minimized by our learned gating function with few-shot sparsity. To demonstrate the efficacy of our results, we experiment in cooperative multi-agent tasks where communication is essential for success. We evaluate our model with both continuous and discrete messages. We focus our analysis on a variety of ablations to show the effect of message representations, including their properties, and lossless performance of our model.},

Prior works on planning with skills often make assumptions on the structure of skills and tasks, such as subgoal skills, shared skill implementations, or task-specific plan skeletons, which limit adaptation to new skills and tasks. By contrast, we propose doing task planning by jointly searching in the space of parameterized skills using high-level skill effect models learned in simulation. We use an iterative training procedure to efficiently generate relevant data to train such models. Our approach allows flexible skill parameterizations and task specifications to facilitate lifelong learning in general-purpose domains. Experiments demonstrate the ability of our planner to integrate new skills in a lifelong manner, finding new task strategies with lower costs in both train and test tasks. We additionally show that our method can transfer to the real world without further fine-tuning.},

Traditional task and motion planning (TAMP) methods can solve complex tasks but require full state observability and are not adapted to dynamic scene changes. Recent learning methods can operate directly on visual inputs but typically require many demonstrations and/or task-specific reward engineering. In this work we aim to overcome previous limitations and propose a reinforcement learning (RL) approach to task planning that learns to combine primitive skills. First, compared to previous learning methods, our approach requires neither intermediate rewards nor complete task demonstrations during training. Second, we demonstrate the versatility of our vision-based task planning in challenging settings with temporary occlusions and dynamic scene changes. Third, we propose an efficient training of basic skills from few synthetic demonstrations by exploring recent CNN architectures and data augmentation. Notably, while all of our policies are learned on visual inputs in simulated environments, we demonstrate the successful transfer and high success rates when applying such policies to manipulation tasks on a real UR5 robotic arm.},

However, model-free methods are known to perform poorly when the interaction time with the environment is limited, as is the case for most real-world robotic tasks. In this paper, we study how maximum entropy policies trained using soft Q-learning can be applied to real-world robotic manipulation. The application of this method to real-world manipulation is facilitated by two important features of soft Q-learning. First, soft Q-learning can learn multimodal exploration strategies by learning policies represented by expressive energy-based models. Second, we show that policies learned with soft Q-learning can be composed to create new policies, and that the optimality of the resulting policy can be bounded in terms of the divergence between the composed policies. This compositionality provides an especially valuable tool for real-world manipulation, where constructing new policies by composing existing skills can provide a large gain in efficiency over training from scratch. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that soft Q-learning is substantially more sample efficient than prior model-free deep reinforcement learning methods, and that compositionality can be performed for both simulated and real-world tasks.},

  abstract = {Constraining contacts to remain fixed on an object during manipulation limits the potential workspace size, as motion is subject to the hand’s kinematic topology. Finger gaiting is one way to alleviate such restraints. It allows contacts to be freely broken and remade so as to operate on different manipulation manifolds. This capability, however, has traditionally been difficult or impossible to practically realize. A finger gaiting system must simultaneously plan for and control forces on the object while maintaining stability during contact switching. This letter alleviates the traditional requirement by taking advantage of system compliance, allowing the hand to more easily switch contacts while maintaining a stable grasp. Our method achieves complete SO(3) finger gaiting control of grasped objects against gravity by developing a manipulation planner that operates via orthogonal safe modes of a compliant, underactuated hand absent of tactile sensors or joint encoders. During manipulation, a low-latency 6D pose object tracker provides feedback via vision, allowing the planner to update its plan online so as to adaptively recover from trajectory deviations. The efficacy of this method is showcased by manipulating both convex and non-convex objects on a real robot. Its robustness is evaluated via perturbation rejection and long trajectory goals. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first work that has autonomously achieved full SO(3) control of objects within-hand via finger gaiting and without a support surface, elucidating a valuable step towards realizing true robot in-hand manipulation capabilities.},

  abstract   = {Dexterous multi-fingered robotic hands can perform a wide range of manipulation skills, making them an appealing component for general-purpose robotic manipulators. However, such hands pose a major challenge for autonomous control, due to the high dimensionality of their configuration space and complex intermittent contact interactions. In this work, we propose deep reinforcement learning (deep RL) as a scalable solution for learning complex, contact rich behaviors with multi-fingered hands. Deep RL provides an end-to-end approach to directly map sensor readings to actions, without the need for task specific models or policy classes. We show that contact-rich manipulation behavior with multi-fingered hands can be learned by directly training with model-free deep RL algorithms in the real world, with minimal additional assumption and without the aid of simulation. We learn a variety of complex behaviors on two different low-cost hardware platforms. We show that each task can be learned entirely from scratch, and further study how the learning process can be further accelerated by using a small number of human demonstrations to bootstrap learning. Our experiments demonstrate that complex multi-fingered manipulation skills can be learned in the real world in about 4-7 hours for most tasks, and that demonstrations can decrease this to 2-3 hours, indicating that direct deep RL training in the real world is a viable and practical alternative to simulation and model-based control. {\textbackslash}url\{https://sites.google.com/view/deeprl-handmanipulation\}},

  abstract = {We propose a new family of policy gradient methods for reinforcement learning, which alternate between sampling data through interaction with the environment, and optimizing a "surrogate" objective function using stochastic gradient ascent. Whereas standard policy gradient methods perform one gradient update per data sample, we propose a novel objective function that enables multiple epochs of minibatch updates. The new methods, which we call proximal policy optimization (PPO), have some of the benefits of trust region policy optimization (TRPO), but they are much simpler to implement, more general, and have better sample complexity (empirically). Our experiments test PPO on a collection of benchmark tasks, including simulated robotic locomotion and Atari game playing, and we show that PPO outperforms other online policy gradient methods, and overall strikes a favorable balance between sample complexity, simplicity, and wall-time.},

  title    = {Addressing {Function} {Approximation} {Error} in {Actor}-{Critic} {Methods}},
  year     = {2018},
  abstract = {In value-based reinforcement learning methods such as deep Q-learning, function approximation errors are known to lead to overestimated value estimates and suboptimal policies. We show that this problem persists in an actor-critic setting and propose novel mechanisms to minimize its effects on both the actor and the critic. Our algorithm builds on Double Q-learning, by taking the minimum value between a pair of critics to limit overestimation. We draw the connection between target networks and overestimation bias, and suggest delaying policy updates to reduce per-update error and further improve performance. We evaluate our method on the suite of OpenAI gym tasks, outperforming the state of the art in every environment tested.},
